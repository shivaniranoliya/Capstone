# Event Innovators

## Overview

This project is divided into two main parts: the frontend and the backend. Each part is located in its own folder. This README will guide you through setting up and running both parts.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Node.js
- npm (Node Package Manager)

## Setup Instructions

### Frontend

1. **Navigate to the frontend directory:**
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```

2. **Install the dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Start the frontend server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

### Backend

1. **Navigate to the backend directory:**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```

2. **Install the dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Start the backend server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

## Additional Information

- The frontend is typically served on `http://localhost:3000` by default.
- The backend is typically served on `http://localhost:5000` by default (or another port specified in your backend configuration).

Make sure both servers are running simultaneously for the application to function correctly.

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter any issues with dependencies, try deleting the `node_modules` folder and `package-lock.json` file in the respective directory and run `npm install` again.
- Ensure there are no port conflicts on your machine.
